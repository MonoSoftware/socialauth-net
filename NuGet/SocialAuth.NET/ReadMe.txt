Thanks for downloading SocialAuth.Net 2.4

*********************
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE
*********************
If you've upgraded from a previous version and have been using Google Wrapper, you'd need to change the name of wrapper from GoogleWrapper to GoogleHybridWrapper in your config as we've upgraded Google Wrapper to use their OAuth 2.0 flow. However, previous OAuth 1.0 Hybrid is still there For more details refer to
